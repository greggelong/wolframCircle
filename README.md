Wolfram Elementary Cellular Automaton plotted around a circle

rules 30, 110, 90, 150

each line is calculated as if it is on a torus

and the generations are plotted around a circle not along the y axis as usual



note the changes with even and odd cell lengths per generation

as the Automaton is displayed on a torus overlaps in size produce different results even for regular patterns like rule 90

the overlaps are affected by size of the canvas and screen and wether or not the number of cells is even or odd

my favorite overlap for rule 90 is a 51 cell row length

it produces something like a generative landscape
